## How to run it 🤔?
- Make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed and [set up](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started) on your local machine.
- Run the command `go mod tidy` for installing external packages, if I have used any or use them in the future.
- All the lessons are categorized as packages inside a respective module (folder 📁). 
- View the `main.go` file for import instructions on how to view each lesson by importing them as packages.
- Run the command `go run .` from the root directory.

**_💡 Note: I have already provided an example on how to import each lesson on the `main.go` file._**
